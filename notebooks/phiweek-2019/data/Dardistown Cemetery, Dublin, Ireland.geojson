                "description": "Dardistown Cemetery, located near Dublin airport, was opened in 1990. The cemetery covers 42 acres and is developed as a lawn cemetery. In order to retain the attractive features of older cemeteries like Glasnevin, Dardistown is developed in sections. Each section is named after saints associated with the locality – St.Columba, St. Margaret and St.Doulagh for example. The entrance to Dardistown is through the original gates and piers for St.Paul’s Section of Glasnevin Cemetery which date back to 1860. <...more (http://significant-cemeteries.blogspot.com/2011/11/dardistown-cemetery-dublin-ireland.html)>"
