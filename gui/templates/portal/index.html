<h4> TOP </h4>
<hr></hr>
<p>TOP is a web-based platform offering users from the atmospheric sciences domain a Virtual Research Environment (VRE) to exploit Copernicus atmospheric and climate data products, such as COPERNICUS Sentinel-5 Precursor data and CAMS products. Deployed on the MUNDI DIAS, it is the first operational platform implementing the data triangle (EO, model and in-situ data) and hence creates an atmospheric multi-source data cube, stimulating a multidisciplinary scientific approach due to the availability of various collections.
The keypoints of TOP are:</p>
<ul>
<li> Based on OGC-standardised (Open Geospatial Consortium) data discovery and access, multiple heterogeneous datasets can be explored simultaneously, without the need to have any knowledge of the original products. </li>
<li> As (new) data available on the DIAS will be directly accessible through TOP, the time to collect and prepare data is omitted.  </li>
<li> Local storage space and personal computer resources are preserved, since all data reside in the remote environment and the processing is performed remotely. </li>
</ul>
<p>TOP offers:</p>
<ul>
<li> A project-based approach</li>
</ul>

<p>Use TOP for your specific project in a collaborative way – Stop worrying about data preparation and sharing during your project duration! 
In addition to existing data, TOP offers you to upload owned data, perform processing, compare and download results.
</br>
Use TOP for specific services – You are looking for a cost efficient and presentation effective way of presenting atmospheric products from multiple sources? This is the right place for you!</p>
